Batting VR is a small virtual reality demo I made with C# and Unity3D. I specifically targeted the HTC Vive but the demo is built on top of VRTK so it should work fine with other VR HMDs such as the Oculus Rift. The player is able to pick up a bat and hit the baseballs that are launched in their direction.
